## History

Built with Elm is a generous project that was started by [Luke Westby](https://github.com/lukewestby), in early [December 2015](https://github.com/lukewestby/builtwithelm/commit/bc05fa3515604fd0aab05aeed351aedfb9cbb6dc), with the intention to showcase the awesome work of the Elm community. He wanted to create a place for people to have their work recognized and for their work to stand as examples for those who are new to the language.

It was then graciously maintained by [Pavan Rikhi](https://github.com/prikhi) as an [elm-community](https://github.com/elm-community) project for a few years before active development waned.

In 2021, [Dwayne Crooks](https://github.com/dwayne) started showing interest in the project and contributed a number of significant improvements which led to him taking it over.
